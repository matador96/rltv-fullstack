  aboutMe: `Iâ€™m a web developer from Krasnoyarsk, Russia. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open-source, and the web platform. My main experience is in full-stack development but I also have a passion for design. Producing a modern website requires a combination of the things such as design, server technology, and layer that users interact with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows making the most optimal user experiences.`,
