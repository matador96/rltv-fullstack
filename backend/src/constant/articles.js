  aboutMe: `Iâ€™m a web developer from Krasnoyarsk, Russia. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform. 
    My main experience is in fullstack development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.`,
